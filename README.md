# Graphic-Poker-Game
Graphic Poker Game is a program written in Python where you can pick some number of players, with some amounts of money (of course the money is merely a number you get to choose), and can start betting and playing like a regular poker game. For now, each player will have their own window, where they can see their own cards, the cards on the table, an information table with everyone's name and amount of bets and etc, and each bet/move that is made is mentioned on everyone's screen. At the end of the game, each player 5 best cards and the winner is mentioned, and the money is allocated accordingly. This program uses tkinter package for the graphic interface, and numpy is used for shuffling and a few other details. This is a work in progress. There are certain tweaks I need to make and a few features that I want to add. I am planning on adding comments and making the code more readable for the public. Also, I will soon add a timer to the pop out window where players pick if they want to "fold", "raise", etc.  My plan for the near future is to turn this into an online game (not using real money of course), and my ultimate goal is to use a database of poker games and machine learning techniques so you'd also be able to play with the computer. I appreciate everyone's feedback!
